## Overview

This script demonstrates how to create and mint Compressed NFTs (cNFTs) on the Solana blockchain using the Metaplex Foundation's UMI library and associated modules.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm (or Bun) installed
- Solana CLI tools
- A Solana wallet with some SOL for transaction fees

## Dependencies

The script uses the following main dependencies:

- `@metaplex-foundation/umi-bundle-defaults`
- `@metaplex-foundation/umi`
- `@metaplex-foundation/mpl-token-metadata`
- `@metaplex-foundation/umi-uploader-irys`
- `@metaplex-foundation/mpl-bubblegum`

## Setup

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Ensure you have a Solana wallet keypair file named `my-keypair.json` in the same directory as the script.

## Configuration

- The script is set to use the Solana devnet. You can change this by modifying the `endpoint` variable.
- A list of recipient addresses is hardcoded in the `fellowAddresses` array.

## Main Functions

### `mintCNFT()`

This is the main function that orchestrates the entire minting process:

1. Sets up UMI with necessary plugins
2. Loads the wallet keypair
3. Creates a Merkle tree
4. Creates a collection NFT
5. Mints compressed NFTs to each address in the `fellowAddresses` array

## Usage

Run the script using Bun:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

## Important Notes

- The script uses pre-uploaded metadata URIs for both the collection and individual NFTs. You may want to customize these or implement dynamic metadata uploading.
- There's a 5-second delay between minting each cNFT to avoid rate limiting issues.
- Ensure you have sufficient SOL in your wallet to cover transaction fees.
- This script is for educational purposes. Always ensure you understand and comply with Solana's rate limits and best practices when deploying to production.

## Security Considerations

- The script reads a wallet keypair file. Ensure this file is kept secure and never shared or committed to version control.
- The keypair is used to sign transactions, so it should have the necessary permissions but contain only the funds needed for the operation.

## Customization

You can customize various aspects of the script:

- Modify the Merkle tree parameters in the `createTree` function call.
- Adjust the collection and NFT metadata.
- Change the recipient addresses in the `fellowAddresses` array.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

- Ensure all dependencies are correctly installed.
- Check that your wallet has sufficient SOL.
- Verify that the `my-keypair.json` file is in the correct location and format.
- If transactions fail, you may need to adjust the delay between mints or handle rate limiting more robustly.1. The most detailed blog on Solana's compression: https://www.helius.dev/blog/all-you-need-to-know-about-compression-on-solana
